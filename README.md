# Gesture Controlled Drone

## Introduction :

This project is based on gesture control. In this project a drone will be controlled by the hand gestures of a user. This project is handled by the DSC ML Team of NIT Patna

## Why this project ?

The gestures elicit a close personal connection with content and enhance the sense of direct manipulation of objects. Gesture controls allow you to navigate without touching any physical buttons.

## Needs of the project :

We require students having experience in ML we also require the ‘App development’ team to develop an app for our project and ‘Hardware team’ to build a drone simulator.

## How it works :

The ML model would be fed with the pre-defined gestures which would produce signals as output. These signals would be transmitted to the drone in order to perform the required manoeuvre.

## Tasks Involved :

- Gathering Data
- Data Exploration and Profiling
- Data Preprocessing
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Choosing the ML model
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model
- Parameter tuning
- Developing a drone simulator
- Testing the model on the simulator

## Dataset

The data in this dataset is collected by the GDSC ML department and has been preprocessed to remove the outliers, missing and inaccurate data. The preprocessed data was then further splitted into training and testing sets.

## Gestures

Following gestures are required to fully control the drone :

| Movement       | Gesture |
| -------------- | ------- |
| North          | Image   |
| South          |         |
| East           |         |
| West           |         |
| North East     |         |
| North West     |         |
| South East     |         |
| South West     |         |
| Speed Increase |         |
| Speed Decrease |         |

## Accuracy

| Model Name             | Accuracy Acheived |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Logistic Regression    | 98.66%            |
| Support Vector Machine | 93.42%            |
| XGBoost                | 98.73%            |
| Linear SVM             | 96%               |
| Decision Tree          | 92.5%             |
| Random Forest          | 92.5%             |
| KNN                    | 91%               |

## What is the time of completion of the project?

We can't set a time limit for this as it is a big project. The process of data collection and construction of drone requires some time and will also contribute in deciding the time limit.
